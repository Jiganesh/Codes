HTML5 introduces more descriptive HTML tags. These include main, header, footer, nav, video, article, section and others.
These tags give a descriptive structure to your HTML, make your HTML easier to read, and help with Search Engine Optimization (SEO) and accessibility.
The main HTML5 tag helps search engines and other developers find the main content of your page.
Example usage, a main element with two child elements nested inside it:
-->

<main> 
    <h1>Hello World</h1>
    <p>Hello Paragraph</p>
</main>
